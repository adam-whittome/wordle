# Wordle
This is my first program written in rust, which I am currently learning to use.
It uses a dictionary of 5 letter words available [here](https://github.com/cheaderthecoder/5-Letter-words).
## To use
Compile the source code, and run the program in the command line.
Enter a 5-letter word as a guess, and if it is a valid word, you will get feedback, otherwise you need to type a different valid word.
